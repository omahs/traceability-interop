    This specification describes discovery and exchange mechanisms, particularly
    as they relate to supply chain use cases. The specification extends the core
    Verifiable Credential API definitions described in the VC-API specification,
    adding cross-security domain interactions. Systems implementing the
    traceability-interop specification can exchange Verifiable Credentials over
    HTTP within proofed Verifiable Presentations. Exchanged Verifiable
    Credentials often implement schemas defined in the traceability-vocab
    specification.
