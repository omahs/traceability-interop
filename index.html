        This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1
        Calendar Year target for major releases. Versioning tags will follow a
        pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]`

        Version Definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>

          MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major

          compatible changes
        </li>
        <li>
          MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new
          functionality or extensions of objects that are backwards compatible
        </li>
        <li>
          PATCH - minor changes that are non breaking and resolve discovered
          issues or bugs
        </li>
      </ul>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided
      automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of
      instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the
      frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of
      incompatible versions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes how verifiable data can be shared securely
        over an authenticated channel. Specifically, a set of OpenAPI HTTP
        endpoints is defined, allowing authenticated data senders and receivers
        to exchange Verifiable Presentations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this interaction-model, the presenting party initiates an
        interaction, notifying the receiver. The presentation receiver responds
        to the presentation intention with cryptographic material for completing
        the presentation. This is used by the presenter for proving the
        Verifiable Presentation, which finally passed to the receiver.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#api-spec">Open API Specification</a> section covers each
        operation and provides example inputs and expected responses.

        <p>
          The above diagram illustrates how traceability-interop fits into the
          larger family of W3C CCG standards.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the <em>Business</em> layer, supply chain actors are exchanging
            data in support of exchanged goods and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Trust</em> layer is supported by actors signing and
            verifying data as Verifiable Credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <em>Process</em> defined standardized APIs for how to exchange
            Verifiable Credentials (VC-API) and Verifiable Presentations
            (trace-interop).

          <li>
            <em>Semantics</em> are defined in a multitude of established
            vocabularies and come in many forms, from narrowly specialized,
            industry-vertical vocabularies, to broadly-applicable, generic
            vocabularies.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.

      <section class="normative">
        <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          As a rule, systems conforming with this specification SHOULD leverage
          and comply with encryption and security guidelines as listed in:
          <a
            href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/5/draft"

            rel="nofollow"
          >FIPS 197</a
          >. This effectively means that committers should be thinking along the
          lines of SHA-256, Ed25519, and Rijndael versus other competing
          algorithms.
        </p>

        <h2>Encryption in Transport</h2>

          Any system conforming with this specification for interoperability

          Special care should be taken to avoid use of obsolete TLS profiles or

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standard or protocol implementation, ignoring accessibility
        issues makes this information unusable by a large subset of the
        population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines and
        standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
